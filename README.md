## OOPs concepts in Java :
Object-oriented programming System([OOPs](https://beginnersbook.com/2013/04/oops-concepts/)) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of “objects” that contain data and methods. The primary purpose of object-oriented programming is to increase the flexibility and maintainability of programs. Object oriented programming brings together data and its behaviour(methods) in a single location(object) makes it easier to understand how a program works.
